# About `scorecard`

The `scorecard` repo contains an R script (in the [`data-raw` folder](https://github.com/jjchern/scorecard/tree/master/data-raw)) that downloads and process raw data from the [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov), 1996-2014. The datasets are stored in the [`data` folder](https://github.com/jjchern/scorecard/tree/master/data).

The data was last updated on January 13th, 2017 (as of August 5, 2017). See the [changelog](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/changelog/) for more details.

# Related R Package

[Benjamin Skinner](https://github.com/btskinner) created a wonderful R client [`rscorecard`](http://btskinner.me/rscorecard/) for the [College Scorecard GET API](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/documentation/).

# Installation

You can also download the datasets as an R package.
The size of the `data` folder is 138.1 MB, so it might take a while to install and load into memory.

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jjchern/scorecard")

# To uninstall the package, use:
# remove.packages("scorecard")
```
